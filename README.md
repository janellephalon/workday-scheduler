# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose 
* The calendar will display the current date at the top of the calendar. 
* The user will be presented with time blocks that represent standard business hours. 
* Each time block is color-coded to indicate if it is in the past, present, or future. 
* Users can add text and save them to a specific time block.
* The added text will save to local storage.
